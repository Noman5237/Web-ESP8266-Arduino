> Step 1: Install the wifiConnect.ino to ESP8266 module

(Change your Wifi credentials in the code manually)

Here is a challenge: Try installing a program to ESP-01 without using NodeMCU or any uart module with just arduino(HINT: Use Serial Ports)

> Step 2: Install readData.ino to Arduino module

> Step 3: Reset the Arduino and then ESP8266

> Step 4: Installed program on ESP uses serial ports to communicate with Arduino, so gear up properly.

If you set your Serial Monitor to 9600 you will see ESP connecting to your local Wifi network and setting up a HTTP server.

Something like:
